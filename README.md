# Decentralized Data Governance Pattern Library

# About
This repository presents a way to contribute to the corresponding '[Decentralized Data Governance Pattern Library](https://beta.portrait.gg/0x1018c3A71997D2171E915ea89f704d9a192823EF)' website.

Contributors can '[open an issue](https://github.com/kelsien/datagovernancepatterns/issues)' to submit a pattern or add comments to comment or add context to an existing pattern.

Just as a software design pattern is a general, reproducible solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design, an institutional infrastructure pattern is an organisations that is reproducible.

Institutional infrastructure is the mechanisms that set the boundaries of social behaviours, coordination, and governance in relation to a protocol. 

This is what this library presents, in relation to IPFS. The aim of this library is to demonstrate how people can compose technical protocols and social patterns into complex, socio-technical systems that are resilient for those that use them. 

# How to Contribute
A pattern submission is considered 'complete' when it in the following format:

Title:

Technology used: (e.g. IPFS, Arweave, Storj, etc)

The Social or Institutional Needs

The Social or Institutional Solution

Case study example: (a couple of lines on how, when, where this pattern applies)

In what context should others choose?

Best practices on how to implement:

Potential challenges:

Links: (if relevant)

Image: (if relevant)

It will be added to the pattern library if considered relevant and appropriate, according to the (subjective) criteria of making a valid contribution to research on decentralised data storage patterns.
